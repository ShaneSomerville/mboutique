##MBoutique Prototype
This prototype was a freshman effort, in which I attempted to replicate the html and css that create a fully fleshed out page that we were shown an image of. Additionally, I went back to this project more recently to add in multiple language functionality. This venture was succesful, if very crude and poorly implemented in the page. Given the oppurtunity, I would clean up and flesh out the multi-language options to make them less disruptive in the page, as well as making it a single page application using Angular Routing.
